# Quantum-Inspired-ML-for-Classification-Using-Amplitude-Encoding-of-MNIST-Dataset

Implemented Classical pre and quantum emulation and post processing on classical processor of Basic Quantum Algorithm using Amplitude encoding for MNiST Dataset.Though the name basic is mentioned, it is rich concept wise as everything is relatively new research wise in quantum domain.
